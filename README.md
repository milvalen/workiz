# Code Explanation Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the Javascript intern test assignment completed by the developer.

### Application Overview

- The application allows users to add a job through an iframe.
- Users can fill in the required fields and save the job details.
- After saving, users can send the job request, which creates a new task.

### Architecture

- The application is built using Vite with React and TypeScript.
- It is divided into UI, application state, and API request service levels.
- Tailwind is used for styling with global styles and reset default styles for consistency.

### Main Features

- The job form includes select field options, and form field validation for content, date, and phone number.
- Validation is done using Zod and regular expressions.
- Field adapters are used to handle form fields and their values.

### Components

- Field adapters like TextAreaAdapter, SelectFieldAdapter, and DateFieldAdapter handle specific field types.
- Button components have variants for different actions like saving form values.
- The form block component provides a minimalistic structure for the main feature.

### Services

CRUD services handle get and post requests for dealing with job fields.

### Utility

- The main validation utility uses the Zod library.
- Button-shared components and types for fields are included.

### Initialization

- The source development kit is initialized in the index.html script through the CDN.
- The iframe is initialized with specific sizes and configurations.

### Configuration

- Tailwind and TypeScript configurations are set up.
- SVGR plugin for rendering icons is used for rendering of SVGs.

### Environmental Setup

- Environmental values like pipedrive-api-endpoint, pipedrive-apikey, and iframe-id are input through the interface.
- These values need to be copied to Netlify for successful application building.
